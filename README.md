## Reflection Sections

### [Midterm Lab Activity 1: Angular Pipes Demo Discussion](ngpipes-demo/src)
This is a demonstration of Angular Pipes. We made use of Date pipes, Chained pipes, Built-in pipes, AsyncPipe, JSONPipe, CurrrencyPipe, SlicePipe, and DecimalPipe

### [Midterm Lab Activity 3: Ng Services](ng-pipes-app(services)/src)
I was wondering how a code can be reused in any component. Services exactly does that. This helps with making the code less redundant and for data connection to be shared across components.
