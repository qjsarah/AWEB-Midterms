## Reflection Section

### [Midterm Lab Activity 1: Angular Pipes Demo Discussion](ngpipes-demo/src)
This is a demonstration of Angular Pipes. We made use of Date pipes, Chained pipes, Built-in pipes, AsyncPipe, JSONPipe, CurrrencyPipe, SlicePipe, and DecimalPipe

### [Midterm Lab Activity 3: Ng Services](ng-pipes-app(services)/src)
I was wondering how a code can be reused in any component. Services exactly does that. This helps with making the code less redundant and for data connection to be shared across components.

### [Midterm Lab Activity 4: Sharing Local Data Across Components](services-lab-act4/src)
Although I was over thirty minutes late to class, this lab activity was easy to follow. I managed to do the activity fast probably because services make it convenient to get data. Coding is less redundant, and I can see the data for employee and product to be easily used across other components. I look forward to exploring more on services at home.

### [MIDTERM CHALLENGE ACTIVITY: HTTP Client Programming Activity](http-client-prg)
This was a take home challenge, exploring REST API and HTTP CLIENT on Angular v18. We made use of JSON Placeholder resources, fetching data from there, instead of manually indicating the data. I managed to fetch data from a resource other than /users. I also made use of SlicePipe from past lessons to limit how many data I want to display.
